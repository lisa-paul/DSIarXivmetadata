## Problem Statement
>For this preliminary study, we asked "Can we predict which research field the article is in, based on its abstract alone?"

## Executive Summary
>	The Data Analyst Think Tank is a cutting-edge research consortium dedicated to advancing scientific insights through rigorous data analysis. Focused on unraveling the complexities of research articles stored at ArXiv, our team employs state-of-the-art analytical methods to extract valuable patterns and trends, contributing to the evolution of scientific knowledge. As the forefront of data-driven research, we aim to bridge gaps in understanding and propel innovation within the scientific community.
>	"This autogenerated mission statement encapsulates the core of our mission."

> We hope this study can lead to better streamlining of categorization and retrieval of scientific knowledge: affording quicker access to relevant information. Successful predictions and auto-categorization can enhance the efficiency of literature reviews, provide reading recommendations for scientists, and suggest publication venues or conferences that a given article may be useful towards.


## What is arXiv?
> arXiv.org is a free-to-access preprint repository that hosts scholarly articles in various fields of science and mathematics. It allows researchers to share their work with the global scientific community before formal peer review and publication, promoting open access and collaboration.

## Data Dictionary
> My source dataset via Kaggle is a mirror of the original arXiv data. Because the full dataset is rather large (1.1TB and growing), this dataset provides only a metadata file in the json format. This file contains an entry for each paper, containing:

| Feature        | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| id             | ArXiv ID (can be used to access the paper)      |
| submitter      | Who submitted the paper                         |
| authors        | Authors of the paper                             |
| title          | Title of the paper                               |
| comments       | Additional info, such as number of pages and figures |
| journal-ref    | Information about the journal the paper was published in |
| doi            | [Digital Object Identifier](https://www.doi.org) |
| abstract       | The abstract of the paper                        |
| categories     | Categories / tags in the ArXiv system            |
| versions       | A version history                                |
